Scheduler for cashiers or other permutable workers, it is based on solving the problem of linear programming.  
### Example 1. Cost minimization with strong staffing requirements  
Strong conditions: manpower needs must be fully met.

### Example 2. Cost minimization with soft staffing requirements  
Soft conditions: manpower needs must be fully met.  
Introduced penalties for not filling the need for labor.
